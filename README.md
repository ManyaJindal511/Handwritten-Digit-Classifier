# ðŸ§  MNIST Digit Classifier â€“ Using ANN (Keras)

This project focuses on classifying handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using a simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) built with Keras. It serves as a foundational deep learning exercise and achieves strong results with minimal architecture â€” making it ideal for understanding the basics of neural networks applied to image classification.

## ðŸ“Š About the Dataset

The MNIST dataset is one of the most widely used datasets in computer vision. It consists of **70,000 grayscale images** of handwritten digits (0 through 9), with:

- **60,000 images** for training  
- **10,000 images** for testing  
- Each image is **28x28 pixels**, centered and size-normalized  
- The task is to classify each image into one of **10 classes** (digits 0 to 9)
  
## âœ… Performance

Using a basic feedforward neural network (ANN) without any convolutional layers, the model achieves an impressive **test accuracy of approximately 97.7%** on the MNIST dataset. 

This result shows that even a simple architecture can perform well on structured and clean datasets like MNIST, making it a great entry point for beginners in deep learning.

## ðŸ“Œ Highlights

- Built using **TensorFlow/Keras**
- Clean and minimal ANN achieving **~97.7% accuracy**
- Excellent for beginners exploring deep learning and image classification
- No complex preprocessing or CNNs â€” just raw pixel values and fully connected layers
